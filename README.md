# NGINX + Node/Javascript + MySQL + Docker + Docker compose

## Challenge description

The goal here is use docker and docker compose to create an application which uses nginx as reverse proxy connecting with node js api that saves data in a MySql database. Always when we access:

    http://localhost:8080

it will create a new register on table people and return all people that are in database.

## How to run this application

Your machine must meet the following requirements:
